jevo.js is a native JavaScript/ES6 based, digital organisms evolution simulator. It's used for study the evolutionary biology of self-replicating and evolving computer programs ([digital organisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_organism)). This project similar to [Avida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avida), but works with more abstract language (Digital Organism Script - DOS) instead of assembler. It uses special DOSVM for running DOS byte code.
